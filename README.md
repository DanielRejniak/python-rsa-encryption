# RSA Encryption

This is a saimple python project to demonstrate how to use public and private RSA encryption keys to encrypt and decrypt text.

Currently the code is capable of encrypting text but in the future it will include file encryption and signature verification.

See the instructions below to run the code.

## Environemnt Setup

Create python 3 environemnt in conda 
```
conda create --name test python=3.9
```
Activate the environment
```
conda activate test
```
Install required packages
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run sample code
```
python sample.py
```
Deactivate the conda environemnt at the end
```
conda dectivate test
```
